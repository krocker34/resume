# Profile

## Short Version

Energetic and creative programmer, currently developing a professional skill-set after years of hobbyist coding.

## Longer Version

### Old
I am a former student of UNC Chapel Hill and QC analyst at Physicianâ€™s Choice Laboratory services. Working in both a clinical lab and a university research environment has ensured a strong understanding of scientific principals and methodology. This includes working with analytical chemistry instruments and large sets of scientific data. I actively seek out new information to complement my existing skills, with a focus on data analysis and machine learning. I am looking for a position with a combination of statistics, data science, and quality related opportunities that can make use of both scientific and computational experience.

### New
I have experience working in both academic research and industry. In both of these settings I've brought a knack for automation, process improvement, and communication between technical and non-technical individuals. I combine a strong grounding in scientific and rational thinking with the ability to break problems down into small, manageable chunks that are easily translated to a computer. I am actively looking to build my skills further in the fields of web development, machine learning, and automation.

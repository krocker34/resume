# Kevin Rocker's Resume

Hello everyone! If you're here, you're probably looking for my resume. Or you're in the wrong place.

While my official, publicly distributed resume is still a word document, I am storing a duplicate (in content if not in formatting) here in Markdown.

The eventual goal of this project is to have a resume written in LaTeX that I can then put completely under version control.

I have blatantly taken one such example from GitHub, which can be found in the adv_latex_example directory, and which this project is technically a fork of.
